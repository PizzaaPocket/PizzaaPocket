# Hello, I am Logan
#### - Here is a little bit about my journey so far:
- I am learning Game Design and Development currently
- I have worked with the Unity game engine a little bit with adding scripts, assets, and changing textures (Basic things)
- I have touched upon the world building aspect of Unity with the terrain tool
- I have worked on a few projects in Unity for practice such as the FPS Microgame, Kart Racing, and creating a small level with a rolling ball
- I am keen on learning and hope to work in the programming field of the development aspect
